The hints will gradually become more challenging, so take your time with each step. I’m curious to see how far you’ll get and what you’ll think by the end. Until then, I’ll leave you to the journey—good luck, and I’ll be glad to hear about your progress later."

There wasn’t really a need to take on the role of Sherlock Holmes when the entire situation could have been resolved with one simple question: “Angel, am I your crush?” Of course, I wouldn’t have given a direct or definite answer, but I definitely would have left you a series of clear hints to guide you. Still, reaching this far says a lot—maybe more than you realize. I’ve always had this slight feeling around you that never disappeared, yes I know how you feel about crushes especially because the people that had one on you where so we say a tad bit weird and also how you get embarrassed I honestly don’t know why the others feel for you probably for your looks I surly didn’t I feel for the girl who worries about the smallest things the one that can show her weakest side but still look strong I don’t think I’ve ever meet someone like that"
