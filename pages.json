The hints will gradually become more challenging, so take your time with each step. I’m curious to see how far you’ll get and what you’ll think by the end. Until then, I’ll leave you to the journey—good luck, and I’ll be glad to hear about your progress later."

      "content": "If you’ve made it to this point, I’m fairly certain you already have an idea of who I like. There was never really a need to play Sherlock Holmes when the entire situation could have been solved with one simple question: “Angel, am I your crush?” I wouldn’t have given a direct answer, of course—but I would have left enough hints to gently lead you there. I’ve never been very good at saying things outright, but I tend to let my actions and small moments speak instead.\n\nThe truth is, I’ve carried a quiet feeling around you for a long time, one that never really disappeared. I don’t know exactly what changed this year—only that something did. Being around you started to feel different in a way I hadn’t experienced before. With you, I felt safe. Safe enough to open up, to share things I don’t usually talk about, and to let my guard down without feeling judged. I found myself doing things I normally wouldn’t, not because I felt pressured, but because being around you made it feel natural.\n\nI know how you feel about crushes, and I know how easily you get embarrassed. I’ve noticed how, whenever I compliment how you look, you immediately try to brush it off—usually with “No, don’t say that,” or sometimes just a quiet “no.” You never let those moments linger, as if you’re hoping the attention passes quickly. But even knowing that, I still want to be honest. Not because I expect anything in return, and not to make you uncomfortable, but because honesty feels important when it comes to something this real.\n\nAnd the truth is, I didn’t fall for you because of how you look—though you are lovely, even if you don’t like hearing it. What I fell for was something deeper and quieter. I fell for the girl who doesn’t give up, even when things feel overwhelming. The girl who worries about the smallest details, who cares deeply about her friends, and who carries so much thoughtfulness without always realizing it. You have a way of showing your weakest side while still being strong, and that kind of strength is rare. I don’t think I’ve ever met someone quite like that before."
